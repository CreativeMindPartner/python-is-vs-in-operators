# python-is-vs-in-operators

Overview
This repository explains the key differences between Python's `is` and `in` operators with practical examples.

The `is` Operator
- Checks for identity (same object in memory)
- Compares memory addresses using `id()`
- Used for `None`, `True`, `False` comparisons

The `in` Operator  
- Checks for membership (value exists in collection)
- Works with lists, strings, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- Returns boolean based on presence

Examples
See `examples.py` for detailed code examples.

Key Takeaway
- Use `is` for identity checks (especially with None)
- Use `in` for membership checks in collections
